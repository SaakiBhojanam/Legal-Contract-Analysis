# Legal Contract Analyzer

This project is a web application designed to analyze legal contracts. Users can paste a contract text into a textarea, and the app will provide various insights such as word count, unique words, sentence count, average sentence length, readability score, and more. Additionally, it generates a word frequency chart and a word cloud based on the most frequent terms in the contract.

## Features
- **Word Count**: Displays the total number of words in the contract.
- **Unique Words**: Shows the count of unique words in the contract.
- **Average Word Length**: Calculates the average length of words in the contract.
- **Sentence Count**: Counts the total number of sentences in the contract.
- **Average Sentence Length**: Provides the average number of words per sentence.
- **Readability Score**: Displays the Flesch-Kincaid readability score.
- **Word Frequency Chart**: A bar chart that displays the top 10 most frequent words in the contract.
- **Word Cloud**: A visual representation of word frequency in the form of a word cloud.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to analyze the contract, compute statistics, and render charts/word clouds.
- **Chart.js**: For generating the word frequency bar chart.
- **D3.js**: For creating the interactive word cloud.

## Acknowledgments

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for the word cloud visualization.
- The Flesch-Kincaid readability formula for assessing readability.
